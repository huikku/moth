Looking at the output you shared, it seems the script did create most of the intended files - including all the documentation files, configuration files, and basic structure files.

What I see from your screenshot is the contents of the `client/src` directory, which shows it created:
- The directory structure (components, contexts, hooks, themes, utils folders)
- The essential React files (App.jsx, index.css, main.jsx)

And from the console output, it created all the documentation files in the `.vibe` directory, configuration files, package.json files, and more.

However, it didn't create the actual component files inside the component directories (like specific React components for the editor, sidebars, etc.). The script should have created placeholder implementations for these components to give you a head start.

For improving your onboarding prompt, I'd suggest adding:

```
FILE_COMPLETENESS:
- Create all placeholder component files with basic implementations
- Include 1 example file in each subdirectory
- For React components, include imports, props definition, and basic JSX structure
- Verify all planned files were successfully created
```

This would ensure that future setups include working placeholder files for all components, not just the directory structure.
