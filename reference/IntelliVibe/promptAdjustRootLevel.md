To ensure future projects are built at the repository root level instead of a subdirectory, you could add specific instructions to the `@PHASE:SETUP` section of your onboarding prompt. Here's what you could add:

```
@PHASE:SETUP
OBJECTIVE: Create implementation scaffolding and documentation
PROCESS:
1. Gather metadata (author, company, license)
2. Generate Python scaffolding script that creates:
   * All files and directories directly in the CURRENT DIRECTORY (repository root)
   * DO NOT create a new project subdirectory
   * .vibe/ directory with documentation files:
     - project-plan.md: Project summary and specifications
     [...]
```

You could also add a specific instruction in the `@DEFINITIONS` section:

```
FILE_LOCATION: All generated files and directories should be placed directly in the repository root, not in a new subdirectory.
```

This explicit instruction should prevent the generation of setup scripts that create unnecessary subdirectories like "screenwriter-ai" within your "IntelliWriter" repository.
